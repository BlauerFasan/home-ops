## 📖 Overview

This is a mono repository for my home infrastructure and Kubernetes cluster. I try to adhere to Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and GitOps practices using tools like [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/), [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2), [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate), and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

---

## ⛵ Kubernetes

### Core Components

- [actions-runner-controller](https://github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller): Self-hosted Github runners.
- [cert-manager](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager): Creates SSL certificates for services in my cluster.
- [cilium](https://github.com/cilium/cilium): Internal Kubernetes container networking interface.
- [traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/) Kubernetes ingress controller using Traefik as a reverse proxy and load balancer.
- [rook](https://github.com/rook/rook): Distributed block storage for peristent storage.
- [sops](https://github.com/getsops/sops): Managed secrets for Kubernetes and Terraform which are commited to Git.
- [spegel](https://github.com/spegel-org/spegel): Stateless cluster local OCI registry mirror.
- [volsync](https://github.com/backube/volsync): Backup and recovery of persistent volume claims.

### GitOps

[Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2) watches the clusters in my [kubernetes](./kubernetes/) folder (see Directories below) and makes the changes to my clusters based on the state of my Git repository.

The way Flux works for me here is it will recursively search the `kubernetes/apps` folder until it finds the most top level `kustomization.yaml` per directory and then apply all the resources listed in it. That aforementioned `kustomization.yaml` will generally only have a namespace resource and one or many Flux kustomizations (`ks.yaml`). Under the control of those Flux kustomizations there will be a `HelmRelease` or other resources related to the application which will be applied.

[Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) watches my **entire** repository looking for dependency updates, when they are found a PR is automatically created. When some PRs are merged Flux applies the changes to my cluster.

### Directories

This Git repository contains the following directories under [Kubernetes](./kubernetes/).

```sh
📁 kubernetes
 ├── 📁 apps           # applications
 ├── 📁 bootstrap      # bootstrap procedures
 ├── 📁 flux           # core flux configuration
 └── 📁 templates      # re-useable components
```

### Flux Workflow

This is a high-level look how Flux deploys my applications with dependencies. Below there are 3 Flux kustomizations `postgres`, `postgres-cluster`, and `atuin`. `postgres` is the first app that needs to be running and healthy before `postgres-cluster` and once `postgres-cluster` is healthy `atuin` will be deployed.

## ☁️ Cloud Dependencies

<!-- While most of my infrastructure and workloads are self-hosted I do rely upon the cloud for certain key parts of my setup. This saves me from having to worry about three things. (1) Dealing with chicken/egg scenarios, (2) services I critically need whether my cluster is online or not and (3) The "hit by a bus factor" - what happens to critical apps (e.g. Email, Password Manager, Photos) that my family relies on when I no longer around.

Alternative solutions to the first two of these problems would be to host a Kubernetes cluster in the cloud and deploy applications like [HCVault](https://www.vaultproject.io/), [Vaultwarden](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden), [ntfy](https://ntfy.sh/), and [Gatus](https://gatus.io/); however, maintaining another cluster and monitoring another group of workloads would be more work and probably be more or equal out to the same costs as described below.

## 🌐 DNS

<!-- In my cluster there are two [ExternalDNS](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns) instances deployed. One is deployed with the [ExternalDNS webhook provider for UniFi](https://github.com/kashalls/external-dns-unifi-webhook) which syncs DNS records to my UniFi router. The other ExternalDNS instance syncs DNS records to Cloudflare only when the ingresses and services have an ingress class name of `external` and contain an ingress annotation `external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/target`. All local clients on my network use my UniFi router as the upstream DNS server. -->

#### 🏠 Home DNS

`k8s_gateway` will provide DNS resolution to external Kubernetes resources (i.e. points of entry to the cluster) from any device that uses your home DNS server. For this to work, your home DNS server must be configured to forward DNS queries for `${bootstrap_cloudflare.domain}` to `${bootstrap_cloudflare.gateway_vip}` instead of the upstream DNS server(s) it normally uses. This is a form of **split DNS** (aka split-horizon DNS / conditional forwarding).

> [!TIP]
> Below is how to configure a Pi-hole for split DNS. Other platforms should be similar.
> 1. Apply this file on the Pihole server while substituting the variables
> ```sh
> # /etc/dnsmasq.d/99-k8s-gateway-forward.conf
> server=/${bootstrap_cloudflare.domain}/${bootstrap_cloudflare.gateway_vip}
> ```
> 2. Restart dnsmasq on the server.
> 3. Query an internal-only subdomain from your workstation (any `internal` class ingresses): `dig @${home-dns-server-ip} echo-server-internal.${bootstrap_cloudflare.domain}`. It should resolve to `${bootstrap_cloudflare.ingress_vip}`.

If you're having trouble with DNS be sure to check out these two GitHub discussions: [Internal DNS](https://github.com/onedr0p/cluster-template/discussions/719) and [Pod DNS resolution broken](https://github.com/onedr0p/cluster-template/discussions/635).

... Nothing working? That is expected, this is DNS after all!


#### 🪝 Github Webhook

By default Flux will periodically check your git repository for changes. In order to have Flux reconcile on `git push` you must configure Github to send `push` events to Flux.

> [!NOTE]
> This will only work after you have switched over certificates to the Let's Encrypt Production servers.

1. Obtain the webhook path

    📍 _Hook id and path should look like `/hook/12ebd1e363c641dc3c2e430ecf3cee2b3c7a5ac9e1234506f6f5f3ce1230e123`_

    ```sh
    kubectl -n flux-system get receiver github-receiver -o jsonpath='{.status.webhookPath}'
    ```

2. Piece together the full URL with the webhook path appended

    ```text
    https://flux-webhook.${bootstrap_cloudflare.domain}/hook/12ebd1e363c641dc3c2e430ecf3cee2b3c7a5ac9e1234506f6f5f3ce1230e123
    ```

3. Navigate to the settings of your repository on Github, under "Settings/Webhooks" press the "Add webhook" button. Fill in the webhook URL and your `bootstrap_github_webhook_token` secret in `config.yaml`, Content type: `application/json`, Events: Choose Just the push event, and save.
